# Take-Me-Out-to-the-Ballgame
Simulates a virtual tour of all the MLB teams' stadiums through the use of a QT Widget application.

Users are able to take a virtual tour of any number of teams' stadiums associated with the NBA. They are able to select
a preferred starting location and an optional ending location, and visit all the stadiums in between those two points
in the most efficient order.
Along the tour, users have the capability of purchasing souvenirs that they desire and are eligible for a refund if
they cancel an order.

Using the core principles in Data Structures and Algorithms, various algorithms will be implemented to 
handle the tour in a way that is optimal for the user. 
Depth First Search and Breath First Search will be used to compute the most efficient order in which
the user should take the tour starting at a selected stadium of their choice. These algorithms will allow
the user to view the next closest stadium once they are at a particular stadium until the tour is finished.
Moreover, Dijkstra's Algorithm will be applied for calculating the most optimal path from a starting location
to any of the other stadiums.
